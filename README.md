# ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Bitcoin ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Edi=====================================https://www.bitcoinedi.org## What is Edinarcoin (EDI)?Edinarcoin is a borderless non-profit peer-to-peer organization. Our vision is to leverage a decentralized platform to solve the many problems created by existing centralized system. Edinarcoin as a blockchain based network will enable tracking of each ledger transaction in a transparent and clear fashion. The token holders of Edinarcoin can pinpoint whoever they are trying to help via our peer-to-peer blockchain accurately.Edinarcoin is a completely self monitored decentralized community. The community will decide on the quantity and receivers of its tokens. The tokens mined each day will be used for charitable purposes, out of which, 17 million will be airdropped to the current holders of Bitcoins (close to the outstanding amount of EDI).  In the remaining 4 million tokens, 400 thousand tokens will be used as POS mining rewards, the other 3.6 million tokens will be used to airdrop for charity. The process will be via users sharing their wallet address to our social network, and the community will vote to decide on the ratio and amount of airdrops. Edinarcoin will become the first charity platform built on a blockchain. Our goal is to fill the world with love and make the world a better place!An ultimate Bitcoin fork solution. There is no additional issuance or pre-digging. All Edi coins distribute 1: 1 to all EDI users and EDI community users. EDI preserves and implements Bitcoin’s advantages such as SegWit. It also has remarkable characteristics:- a fork of Bitcoin after block height 501225.- Per-block difficulty adjustment algorithm.- Replay protection (SIGHASH_FORK_ID).- Unique wallet addresses (prefixes of g).- A Proof of Stake consensus system which is secure and energy efficient.## Edinarcoin FEATURES
- Total distribution: 21 million- All holders of Bitcoin will receive an equal proportion AirDrop of EDI tokens.- The remaining tokens will be distributed to EDI token holders and networks through POS mechanisms.- The Edinarcoin foundation prohibites the issuance of additional tokens.- Daily output will be distributed to community users.## Edinarcoin PurposeEnding the current Bitcoin forking chaos, restoring decentralized blockchain like Bitcoin and addressing the inherent congestion in Bitcoin. Enpowering a better blockchain community and allowing for continued development of blockchain technology## Specifications
